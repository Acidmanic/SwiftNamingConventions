About
====

NamingConventions is a library amied to help converting Name/IDs following different Naming Conventinos to each other. for example you might have a string with a given or even unknown naming-convention, and you want it to be converted to say a snake-cased-string. 

Example
=====

To use the code, you will just create an instance of **ConventionConverter** class, call the method: *autoConvert(from:&lt;name-id-string&gt;,to:&lt;destination-convention&gt;)*. and the result will be your string following the destination naming convention.


```swift
	let converter = ConventionConverter()
	let convention = NamingConventions.SnakeCase
	let src = "MyFieldName"
	let result = converter.autoConvert(from: src, to: convention)
	print(src + " -> " + result)
```
output:

```bash
	MyFieldName -> my-field-name
```


**NamingConvention**:

You can get an object of a naming convention from the class: **NamingConventions**. you also can create one using its initializer (constructor) like: 
```swift
 let myConvention = NamingConvention(starter: "_", firstParticle: ParticleCase.Lower, otherParticles: ParticleCase.Pretty, separator: "")
 
```
